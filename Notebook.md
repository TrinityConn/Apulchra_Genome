# Acropora Pulchra Genome Assembly 

## collaboration with Jill Ashey 

### 06112024
Met with Ross, Hollie and Jill to establish status of genome assembly. Jill is currently removing contaminant reads (bacteria, viruses, symbionts etc.). Jill is trying to work on getting MitoHifi to work, and then the next steps will be to ID and mask repeats, and then annotate the genome using Funannotate.
