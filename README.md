# Apulchra_Genome
Updates for code and progress on Acropora pulchra genome in collaboration with Jill Ashey, Hollie Putnam, and Ross Cunning. 

This repository is alongsdie Jill's main github project and updates, at (https://github.com/JillAshey/JillAshey_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2024-02-06-Apulchra-Genome-Assembly.md)

Jill has completed the initial assembly, cleaning, and removal of mitochondrial sequences on the PacBio HiFi reads of Acropora pulchra. I will be taking over to help finish the genome annotation and final assembly of the pulchra genome, to hopefully use alongside my shallow whole genome sequencing data.
